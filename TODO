	- SMS module
	- push module
    - CDRs / connection logs

IDEAS:
    - news paper
        a daemon looks at website news
        for each news, publish link to a topic

        client receive news notification
        display a popup + a box into the application
        buttons: ignore |Â read now | archive/readit later
            ignore => trash
            read now => open the browser on news page
            read later => add it to pocker/poche/whatever

    - security
        server publish
